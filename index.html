  <div class="my-name-is">Hi there! My name is Rawan, I'm a 23 years old Palestinian girl, who was born in Gaza, lived her childhood in Bethlehem and teenage years in Hebron, I come from a mixed family, my father is Palestinian but my mother is Algerian, I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my favorite colors are black and red, my favorite season is Autumn and I love singing, dancing, languages and traveling. If you want to know more about me, just keep reading.</div></p></div>


  <h2>* My education & career:</h2>
     <div id="i-finished"><p>I finished high school in 2014 and had no money nor moral support to go into college, so I stayed at home doing nothing for a little while, I got depressed so I had to get out and start a life of my own, so I started working as a retail worker at a clothes shop, then a secretary, a seller at a cake shop, then I worked in a cosmetics shop and stayed there for year. throughout my work I always felt misplaced, I didn't want to do these things, I wanted something special,  not to degrade  these businesses or anything but I didn't want to invest my time and skills to make someone else's dream bigger, I wanted to work on my own, and my dream needed a lot of money and free time to focus on it, and those jobs paid very little since I'm a girl, and took all my time, I worked from 8am- 6pm, so when I got home I barely had time to eat and sit with my family and sleep, I had no social life, no friends, nothing, I was isolated, I always wanted a way out but all the opportunities needed money and connections and I had neither. Till one day I heard one of my friends mention a free program that teaches you stuff like sewing, Architecture, and secretary, so I left my job and enrolled in it, I really liked it because not only was it free, and gave you a diploma-which is the only kind of degree I could afford- but it had two great teachers who actually cared about you as a person and wanted you to be great and do great things, so I came first and had an internship in a great company for one month, I learned a lot and met nice people who appreciated my work, though there were two other girls there who came from college, they liked me better because I took it seriously unlike the others.</p>
    
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't find a job after, that paid well with my degree, so I ended up working in a tailor's shop as a beginner so I can learn sewing and make a career out of it, maybe then I could have enough money to do what I actually love, but I dropped out after only two months because the salary wasn't great and I had to get a better paying job to help my family financially, and ended up my current job which is a cleaning lady at a small company which surprisingly pays better than a job I would get with my Secretary degree, yeah that's how much education means in my country.</p></div>
    
<h2>* My interests:</h2>
<ul><h3><li>Learning</li></h3>
  <div id="maybe-by"><p>Maybe by now you noticed my love for learning new, interesting things, maybe not, but let me tell you that I really do love it and try to learn new things, and I really hate that my country takes education only as a business and as something to only get money out of, especially since we are occupied by Israel, they really should make the best education system in the world and make it available for all, maybe only then we could really have our country back </p></div>

  <h3><li>Languages</li></h3>
  <div id="i-just"><p>I just LOVE languages, my dream is to one day open any book, tv channel, internet page etc, in any language and just understand it without needing any help whatsoever, I know it's a big dream but I want to make it a reality.</p>

    <p>I guess this started when I was a 13 years old girl, my older brother used to watch a lot of American movies and I just hated it, but I nothing else to do, we only had one tv and no computers or smartphones like nowadays, I had no friends too so I had no choice but to sit with him and watch, I think I hated it at first because I didn't understand the language, and the translation was gone before I could read it, but little by little I developed my fast reading skills and I actually started understanding some of the language, and I asked my brother's help with the words I didn't know and started to form a connection between what I hear in movies and what I learned in school. Soon enough I knew more words than anyone in my age or older than me, and I was popular in school for being smart in English and it became my favorite subject in school because I got really good grades in it without even studying for the tests, and now I'm hoping to major in English at college someday</p></div>

  <h3><li>Music</li></h3>
    <div id="music-is"><p>Music is quite amazing, I think it's a universal language, you could hear a song from a language that you don't understand, and you would have no idea what they are saying, but you still feel what it, if not from the way the singer is emotionally singing it, at least the music itself will move you, it might even become your favorite song, and I don't think that it only happens to me, just look at <em>Despacito</em> or <em> Gangnam style</em>, they went through the roof in countries that didn't understand a word of them,  and I think that is what makes <em>music so magical</em>, other than that I love singing and I hope I can take singing classes in the near future and learn a musical instrument as well.</p></div>

  <h3><li>Books</li></h3>
    <div id="my-love"><p>My love for books began as an escape from reality and free time, instead of doing nothing I would download books to read or get some from the library, I had a library card and everything, but I ended up not using mine so often because the library opened and closed while I was at work, so I got my little sister to user hers and git me some books, I love a good book that makes you feel a ton of emotions and teaches you something new at the same time, those kind of books are my favorites.</p></div></ul>

  <h2>* Why I'm a good candidate to enroll in this Bootcamp:</h2>
    <ul><div id="this-is"><li><p>This is not a picnic for me, I knew nothing about programming and I started learning just for this. Like I said before my country doesn't really care about education that much, so when I heard about this I wasn't so enthusiastic about it, I thought it would be just another program that comes and goes without making a real impact, but when my sister enrolled in the first cohort and I got to hear from her about it and I got to go to some lectures and actually see for myself how it's so great, and the people managing it really care about it, about the students and about what  they are teaching, and it's not  just something they want to finish and get paid for, I got excited and it gave me a reason to go on with life, because up until that moment I had nothing, so <strong>I WILL</strong> work hard for this.</p></li>

    <li><p>Programming is <em>unique</em> in general, but even more unique in my country, so this is like a superpower, if you know something that not a lot of people know how to do, you get recognized very fast, you get a better paying job, <strong><em>you</em></strong> get to choose where to work, and when, and this is what I'm looking for, I want to do so many things and I don't want to be imprisoned by an 8-5 desk job, that takes all my time and energy, and just sucks the life out of me, I wasn't made for this and <strong>I</strong> will keep fighting it till the end.</p></li>

    <li><p>I saw on your website that people can apply to be mentors, and I just loved that, I not only love learning, but I also love teaching people and sharing what I know, so I really hope I get the chance to be one of you and mentor, I'm a bit shy so it' will help me get out of my comfort zone and do something that I love, along with meeting interesting new people and sharing and gaining life experience.</p></li></div></ul>
